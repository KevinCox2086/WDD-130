                    <p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running trips down
                        the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon introducing over 800
                        people to one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 4 new guides and welcomed them
                        to our family.</p>
                    <p>The season started off with some chilly weather in the early season, but our guests
                        braved the cold and loved every minute of their trip (show pictures).Later the
                        temperatures soared reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the
                        Salmon. We didn't have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.

                    <p>Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States. We share 
                        these areas with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what to
                        do if you should find yourself face to face with one.</p>

                    <p><b>Scorpions</b>: There are hundreds of varieties of scorpions, most of them being
                        harmless. There are, however, a handful of them that can be dangerous and even
                        potentially lethal. Scorpions can be found in almost every ecosystem and are very
                        adaptable to their environment. The scorpion that calls Phantom Ranch in the
                        Grand Canyon home is the Bark Scorpion, the most venomous in the United States. 
                        Do not worry though, the bark scorpions are only lethal to their prey and luckily 
                        humans are not on that list!</p>
                    <p>They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, moths, 
                        spiders and other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can 
                        be found with ice, aspirin and time.</p>
                    <p>When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear your shoes 
                        or sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are going. Never try to capture a 
                        scorpion and if you get stung, see your guide immediately.</p>

                    <p><b>Big Horn Sheep</b>: For many people, bighorn sheep symbolize the rugged mountain west. 
                        It is one of two species of wild sheep in North America. Its compact body is muscular with 
                        chocolate brown fur. Most weigh 160-250 lbs. They have exceptional vision, hearing and smell
                        that helps them detect and avoid predators.</p>
                    <p>Their large curved horns can weigh up to 30 lbs. Females also have horns but they are short 
                        with a slight curvature. Horns are used as tools for eating and fighting.</p>
                    <p>If you encounter a big horn sheep, donâ€™t agitate it. The park service asks that you stay 
                        100 feet away from big game animals. Leave them enough room for escape if they feel 
                        threatened.</p>
