    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Kevin Cox</h2>
    <p>I am currently working towards my Bachelors of Professional Studies.
    One of the many hobbies that I have is blacksmithing. While I am just 
    starting out it is something that I look forward to doing. Before starting 
    school full-time I had worked at Lowe's for 18 years. The eduaction that I am 
    currently pursuing has no clear purpose towards getting a better job in the long 
    run but will enable me to if I were to decide to do so.
